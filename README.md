   - Click "Load Example" to test with sample data

2. **View Differences**:

## Example

```json
// Left JSON
{
  "name": "Product A",
  "price": 19.99,
  "details": {
    "weight": "2kg",
    "dimensions": {
      "width": 10,
      "height": 5
    }
  }
}

// Right JSON
{
  "name": "Product B",
  "price": 24.99,
  "details": {
    "weight": "2.5kg",
    "dimensions": {
      "width": 10,
      "height": 6
    },
    "warranty": "2 years"
  }
}
```

In this example:
- `warranty` field will be highlighted in green (present only in right JSON)
- `price` and `weight` values will be highlighted in gray (different values)
- `height` value will be highlighted in gray (different values)
- `name` and `width` will have no highlighting (different values but same type)
